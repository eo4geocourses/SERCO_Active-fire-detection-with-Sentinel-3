# Active Fire Detection with Sentinel-3 data

Content: 
This training is addressed to non-experts in EO and modelling, but for students or professionals who may be using EO data for quick active fire detection, when the fire event occurs in their area or when such information will be needed at their current work f.e. for the purpose of forest management. Participants of this webinar will understand how to download, process, analyse and visualize free data acquired by the Copernicus satellites. They will also learn the methodology proposed for the active fire detection using Sentinel-3 satellite imagery. Using this method, the information on areas actively burning can be assessed very quickly and the estimation of the damages the fire caused can be estimated.  
Training will be divided into following sections: 
* Introduction to the study area and data
* Demonstration of the Sentinel-3 data processing for active fire detection 
* Live Q&A session

Data used: 
Two cloud-free Sentinel-3A Level 1B RBT products acquired on June 18, 2017 (after the main event) downloadable at: @ https://scihub.copernicus.eu

Software: Internet browser, SNAP + Sentinel-3 Toolbox, QGIS,  Extra steps: Google Earth 

Learning outcomes: 
* Understand the concept and characteristics of Sentinel-3 SLSTR instrument and data it provides 
* Understand principles of data processing 
* Become familiar with the concept of active fire detection using Sentinel-3 data (night and day-time detection) 
* Create a fire detection algorithm (night and day-time) and visualize areas with active fires
* Compare results with operational monitoring from Global Wildfire Information System
